algorithm:

- Task is to find any 1 peak element.
- if we are ina increasing or decreasing slope, we can never find peak
  hence we eliminate that half, and move to other half, until peak is found
- Edge case will be {1, 5, 1, 2, 1}, here the nums[2], wont satisfy any condition
  as its at the loewst point(opposite of peak), hnce in this case, we
  can move any half, as peak will exist in both.

162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always
considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
