/* Properties of friend functions

1. Not in the scope of class  (no need to use '::')
2. since it is not in the scope of the class, it cannot be called from the object of that
   class. c1.sumComplex() == Invalid
3. Can be invoked without the help of any object
4. Usually contains the objects as arguments
5. Can be declared inside public or private section of the class
6. It cannot access the members directly by their names and need object_name.member_name
   to access any member.
